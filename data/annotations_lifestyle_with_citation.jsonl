[2]\nResearch has concluded that adding seat belts to trains does not increase safety. [2] \nThe intrinsic safety of trains stems from factors like their restricted movement on tracks, which simplifies safety management compared to vehicles that can move in multiple dimensions. [3] \nRail safety engineering emphasizes that train crashes are exceedingly rare due to infrastructure design and strict adherence to signaling systems that enforce safe distancing. [3]\nFurthermore, rapid deceleration, rather than speed itself, is the main cause of injuries in vehicle crashes, and trains, due to their considerable weight, are less likely to experience such sudden deceleration unless they encounter something exceptionally heavy, such as another train or a significant obstacle on the tracks. [4] \nHence, because derailments and severe collisions are infrequent, the use of seat belts on trains is not considered necessary, as the likelihood of such events is minimal.

[1]\nFor a more advanced approach, a rotary evaporator can be used to create a concentrated ginger extract. [1]\nSimmering the ginger for an extended time allows more flavor to be extracted. [2]\nIt is also suggested that stirring frequently can shorten the necessary cooking time. [2]\nIf you cook the same ginger multiple times with fresh water each time, you might extract more flavor overall compared to a single, longer cooking session. [2]\nCutting ginger into thin slices and steaming for about half an hour, before air drying, is another method to concentrate its flavor and alter its properties, which can be subsequently boiled to release flavors. [3]\nA mixture of sliced ginger soaked overnight at room temperature in a grain alcohol and water solution, with both alcohol and water in equal parts, can then have the liquid drained and used for its flavor. [4]\nMaximizing flavor extraction from ginger can also be achieved by mashing or grinding it as finely as possible, with the suggestion of adding alcohol such as vodka to improve the process, which is then filtered afterwards. [5]\nUsing a pressure cooker is an alternative cooking technique that can yield excellent ginger flavors, and adding flavor enhancers like lemon zest is also recommended. [6] \nRoom-temperature preparations and cold extraction techniques can also be employed to focus on preserving volatile compounds, with the idea of using a two-phase extraction process involving water and then alcohol or oil.

[1]\nThe cooking duration for tomato sauces can vary: a long simmer on low heat results in a dense, smooth sauce suitable for ragu, whereas a shorter cook time on high heat produces a lighter sauce. [2]\nA prolonged, gentle simmer improves the flavor of 'stewing' sauces, with flavors intensifying over time. [3]\nFor meat ragus, extended simmering is necessary for meat to cook thoroughly and for connective tissues to break down, creating a sauce with the right consistency. [4]\nWhile longer cooking times can tenderize ground meat, it may also lead to a loss of distinct flavors after about 1.5 hours. [5]\nThe cooking period for sauces is contingent on factors like the type of sauce and desired outcome; long cooking is ideal for certain sauces, whereas fresh tomato sauces require minimal cooking time. [6]\nCooking pasta sauce over low heat for an extended period can enhance both meat texture and overall flavor. [7]\nTo maximize the benefits of long cooking, ensure sufficient liquid is present, possibly supplementing with stock to maintain the sauce's flavor intensity. [8]\nUltimately, personal taste should guide whether to opt for a sauce cooked briefly for freshness or simmered for several days for depth of flavor.
