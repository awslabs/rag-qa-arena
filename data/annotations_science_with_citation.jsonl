{"qid": "science-forum-test-266", "question": "obvious theorems that are actually false", "answer": "There are many examples of obvious theorems that are actually false. \nFor one, in most cases, the Jordan-Brouwer separation theorem is indeed correct in stating that embedding a 2-sphere into 3-dimensional Euclidean space segments it into two non-overlapping regions.  \nNonetheless, it is incorrect to generalize this to say that these regions are homeomorphic to the inner and outer sections of the unit sphere.  \nA striking example of seemingly evident yet incorrect theorems includes the Banach-Tarski paradox, which demonstrates that there are sets that cannot be measured and that partitions may not preserve measure. \nAdditionally, there exists an integrable function on an interval whose Fourier series is divergent at every point, which is particularly surprising because typically, for most functions, the Fourier series converges in most places. \nCertain intuitively true theorems are flawed, such as the nonexistence of a continuous, nowhere-differentiable real function, or the claim that a connected metric space must be path-connected.  \nAnother incorrect assumption includes believing that an infinite family of strictly positive numbers will always sum to infinity, which underpins the misconception in Zeno's paradox, and more contemporarily, Gabriel's Horn paradox.  \nThe continuum hypothesis also presents a puzzle in set theory since it lacks an answer in ZFC (Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory with the Axiom of Choice). \nIt is a misconception that for a function that is infinitely differentiable on an interval, if it approaches zero as the variable goes to infinity, then its derivative must also tend to zero;

[4] \n\"Sets for Mathematics\" is a gentle introduction to category theory without requiring a profound background. [5] \nThe \"First Chapter of Jacobson's Basic Algebra -II\" contains crucial introductory material. [6] \nAnother excellent resource is the \"nLab\", which is widely recognized for its wealth of information on category theory. [7] \nTom Leinster's lecture notes serve as another resource that\u2019s considered intermediate in difficulty and provide a comprehensive overview of category theory. [8] \nOnline resources are abundant, including \"Abstract and Concrete Categories\" and lecture notes from Steve Awodey, which are freely available. [9] \nEven though it's on the pricier side, \"Awodey's new book\" offers a fresh perspective on category theory from a logician\u2019s point of view. [10] \nFor those interested in the intersection of category theory and computer science, Barr and Wells have authored \"Category Theory for the Computing Sciences\". [11] \nGoldblatt's \"Topoi\" is another accessible work that introduces basics of category theory. [12] \nFor a brief overview, \"Introduction to Category Theory\" by Peter Selinger is concise, and the \"Handbook of Categorical Algebra\" by Francis Borceux is a comprehensive resource. [13] \nPeter Freyd's book presents abelian categories entertainingly and insightfully. [14] \nAdditional resources for different applications include works by Lawvere and Rosebrugh, and Fiadeiro, which touch upon sets and software engineering respectively. [15] \n\"Algebra: Chapter 0\" by Paolo Aluffi interweaves category theory throughout its text. [16] \nFor various levels of study, \"Basic category theory\" by Jaap van Oosten, and \"Introduction in Higher order categorical logic\" by Lambek & Scott offer materials ranging from beginner to advanced topics. [17] \nSupplemental reference texts can be found in the appendix of \"Abstract-Algebra\" by Dummit & Foote and in Harold Simmons\u2019 \"An introduction to Category theory\". [18]\nCarl Faith's \"Algebra:Rings Modules and Categories\" intertwines category theory with algebraic concepts. [19] \nHerrlich and Strecker have written \"Category Theory: An Introduction,\" which is well-regarded, and another book, \"Abstract and Concrete Categories: The Joy of Cats,\" although the latter is not as highly esteemed. [20] \nTom Leinster's \"Basic Category Theory\" is a recent addition that effectively introduces category theory with a modern touch. [21]\nEmily Riehl's \"Category theory in context\" is an elegant introduction that includes numerous examples from various mathematical disciplines. [22] \nFor programmers, \"Category Theory for Programmers\" by Bartosz Milewski, accompanied by video lectures, can be very illuminating. [23] \nAn \"Introduction to Applied Category Theory Course\" offered by MIT and conducted by David Spivak and Brendan Fong provides a unique perspective suitable even for those with software engineering backgrounds.

[7] \nThe multiplication of integers demonstrates fundamental mathematical properties such as distributivity, associativity, and the nature of the integers as a free group. [8] \nThe Jordan Curve Theorem is an intuitive concept that becomes intricate upon close examination, with algebraic topology offering profound insights. [9] \nEuler's Polyhedral Formula may be simple to teach, but has led to significant developments in topology and geometry. [10] \nThe Clairaut-Schwarz theorem assures the equality of mixed partials, affecting exterior differentiation and impacting substantial areas of topology. [11] \nThe Newlander-Nirenberg Theorem in complex geometry, Darboux' Theorem in symplectic geometry, and concepts such as the equality of mixed partials and the Frobenius Theorem share this paradigm with broad implications for geometry and topology.

[3]\nIn practice, trigonometry proves indispensable for solving real-world problems, ranging from determining building heights using right triangle trigonometry to finding river widths through the laws of sines and/or cosines. [4]\nThe widespread use of trigonometry and exponential functions is evident in virtually all areas of applied mathematics. [5]\nAdditionally, trigonometric identities contribute to addressing classic 'impossible problems,' such as 'angle trisection'. [6]\nThe expression $e^{i\\theta} = \\cos \\theta + i \\sin \\theta$ serves as a powerful tool, repeatedly employed to prove theorems across various fields, including number theory, complex analysis, probability, Fourier analysis, and astronomy. [7]\nComplementing the multitude of applications, trigonometric functions also find utility in combinatorics, further emphasizing their versatility and importance in theoretical mathematics.

[2, 4]\nArtin's book on the reconstruction of algebraic structures, represents a different meaning to Geometric Algebra, rather than Clifford algebras, quaternions, and related ideas, which is popularized by Hestenes. [3]\nFor those specifically looking for a text that integrates linear algebra with geometric algebra, Alan Macdonald's \"Linear and Geometric Algebra\" is an excellent starting point. [4]\nPertti Lounesto's \"Clifford Algebras and Spinors\" and Porteous's Clifford Algebras and the Classical Groups touch on the application of geometric algebra in physics, providing a purely mathematical perspective. [5]\nAdditionally, Eric Chisolm's paper on ArXiv.org is quite accessible and contains a good collection of references for further study. [6]\nFor beginners, the book \"Geometric Algebra: An Algebraic System for Computer Games and Animation\" is highly recommended for its clear and concrete explanations. [7]\nIf you are looking for a clear and rigorous introduction to geometric algebras, consider the 2016 \"An Introduction to Clifford Algebras and Spinors\" by Jayme Vaz Jr and Rold\u00e3o da Rocha Jr. [8]\nLastly, Andreas Ros\u00e9n's book \"Geometric Multivector Analysis: From Grassmann to Dirac,\" although aimed at advanced undergraduates, provides a thorough and clear presentation of the subject.
