{"qid": "technology-search-test-579", "question": "what is the difference between link local and unique local?", "answer": "Well-formed answer\n-------------------\n\nIPv6 link-local addresses are obligatory and non-routable, restricted to a single link which has a uniform link-local network.  These addresses function for single-link operations such as automatic configuration and neighbor discovery, and routers are prohibited from forwarding packets with these addresses across different links.  On the contrary, unique local addresses (ULAs), while similar to IPv4's private addresses, are routable within certain local scopes but not on the global internet.  Initially, a part of the ULA space was reserved for centralized allocation to ensure uniqueness, but this has not transpired, resulting in their reservation status.

[11] \nJava is seen as complicated, with developers finding it easier and quicker to make changes in PHP compared to the restarts often required for Java applications, and the cost of hosting Java applications is also a concern. [12] \nFramework-based systems like Ruby on Rails provide an easier learning curve and faster setup than Java, which requires learning the language and additional frameworks or tools. [13] \nJava's syntax is criticized as too verbose and the development process is seen as cumbersome, especially when compared to the simplicity of other languages and frameworks. [14] \nThe issue with Java in startups is about the trade-off between speed and scalability; startups need to move fast and iterate, which can be done more effectively with simpler languages and frameworks. [15] \nJava is seen as requiring a medium-sized team to see efficient implementation results, and the options in Java's ecosystem can be overwhelming, coupled with a lack of proper web hosting solutions. [16] \nJava is verbose and the community is seen as less innovative, with developers gravitating towards languages like Ruby, Python, or PHP, which are seen as more \"friendly\" and \"fun\". [17] \nTo differentiate from the masses, developers learn new languages as Java is seen as the language of everyone, with other languages being more connected to modern web development. [18] \nJava is complex to learn and its ecosystem can be overwhelming, especially for beginners, whereas properly configured Java environments can be highly productive. [19] \nJava and J2EE may have been associated with long development cycles and heaviness, and alternatives in other languages are seen as offering a unified solution rather than a multitude of options. [20] \nJava is associated with a slower development time compared to languages like Python, and in web frameworks, Java's heavy resource requirements and lack of good shared hosting options are disadvantages. [21] \nThe complexity often found in Java applications is seen as a result of the mindset of some developers within the Java community. [22] \nJava's verbosity and lack of certain modern language features can make development frustrating in comparison to dynamic languages that offer faster iterations in web development. [23] The \"cool kids\" in the developer community may use languages like Ruby because they solve problems in still simpler and time- and effort-saving ways, leaving Java due to its perceived difficulty and annoyance. [24] \nJava's lack of multiline string support and unsatisfactory web frameworks contribute to a challenging environment for creating web applications. [25] \nJava can be used efficiently and \"hackily\" to quickly build systems, but the inclination to overcomplicate projects can result from the extensive knowledge and tools available within the Java ecosystem.

[3]\nEncapsulation, which makes the external interface of the class explicit, and is fundamental concept of object-oriented programming, leverages private variables to ensure that the corresponding variable remains in the defining class only. [4]\nIn essence, private variables ensure that later references outside the scope of an object or function won't inadvertently affect other variables. [5] \nThey also make it easier to expand code in the future, without relying on heavy documentation as to what the many public variables do. [5]\nThere's less of a threat of accidentally breaking functionality if fewer variables can be overwritten. [5]\nVariable scope allows you to show consumers of your code what they can and cannot alter. [6] \nA person wanting to change the code would have to work very hard and have really high runtime permissions in order to change it. [6]\nEncapsulation goes beyond mere discretion; it's about not overloading the user of the class with unnecessary details, and facilitating autonomous changes to a class without affecting other classes that may rely on it. [7]\nIncreased encapsulation results in cleaner, more reliable code by reducing the interdependence of different code parts. [10]\nFurthermore, opting for private over public variables helps guide the design mindset from the get-go, prompting careful consideration of how class internals are exposed to users, leading to more thoughtful API creation. [8]\nIt's important to recognize which aspects of a class are core functionality and which are meant for interaction with external code. [9] \nLastly, private variables are good to avoid misuse leading the object into an inconsistent status, hard-to-track bugs, and unforeseen exceptions and are also excellent for protected fields.

[3] \nClient-side hashing is typically considered only when there is an inherent distrust of the server, with preferential use being for situations where the password is reused on multiple sites. [4] \nNevertheless, hashing server-side is crucial, and while client-side hashing can complement server-side methods, it should not replace them. [5] \nHowever, reliance on client-side hashing necessitates handling scenarios where users have disabled Javascript because hashing the password client-side will require Javascript. [6]\nLastly, hashing at the client side, when supported by the backend, means that the hash effectively becomes the password, which can be compromised in a hack. [7]\nA potential solution is to hash passwords on the client side and then hash them again server side; this adds a layer of security against different attack vectors.

[3] \nFor a more straightforward option, you could use the built-in $RANDOM variable in bash, translating numbers into letters: `$ echo $RANDOM | tr '[0-9]' '[a-z]' bfeci $ echo $RANDOM | tr '[0-9]' '[a-z]' cijjj `. [4]\nSome use `cat /dev/urandom | tr -dc 'a-zA-Z0-9' | fold -w 10 | head -n 1` to produce a 10-character string. [5] \nFor a completely random password, md5pass can be employed, allowing you to use normal text with a salt for added security. [6] \nShuffling a file of characters or words with shuf and then removing line terminators with tr is another recommended option: `shuf --random-source=/dev/urandom --repeat --head-count=20 file_with_characters | tr --delete '\\n' shuf --random-source=/dev/urandom --repeat --head-count=7 file_with_words | tr '\\n' ' ' `. [7] \nIf you're looking for an easy solution, openssl's rand command provides a quick way to generate a random base64 or hex string: `openssl rand -base64 12 or openssl rand -hex 12`. [8]\nShould you require a random string of a specific length, you can use `shuf -zer -n20 {A..Z} {a..z} {0..9}`. [9] \nAPG can help to generate passwords from size 5 to 10 in subsets Special, Numeric, Capital and Lower: `apg -MSNCL -m 5 -x 10`. [10] \nTo include all ASCII printable characters in your password: `< /dev/urandom tr -cd \"[:print:]\" | head -c 32; echo`. [11] \nFor passwords that avoid easily confused characters:`base64 < /dev/urandom | tr -d 'O0Il1+/' | head -c 44; printf '\\n' `. [12] \nAdjusting password length with base64, tr, and cut commands allows for customizable password generation: `$ cat /dev/urandom | base64 | head -n 1 |tr -dc '[:alnum:]' |cut -c -13 b0R55751vWW9V `. [13] \nYou can create highly secure passwords using/dev/urandom combined with tr for a wide range of characters or folding and heading for multiple passwords: `cat /dev/urandom | tr -cd [:graph:]|head -c 16`. [14]\nEmbracing Unix philosophy, you could also use base64 encoding with /dev/urandom and dd to control output size: . [15] \nLastly, the xxd command offers length specification through its parameters, which is convenient across different operating systems.
